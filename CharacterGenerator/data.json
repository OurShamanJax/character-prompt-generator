        "backstory": "Grew up in a hyper-competitive household where her parents demanded academic and professional excellence. Her older brother was a model student, leading to constant comparison; she felt pressured to outperform him at all costs.

        "needs": "A need for structure and control in her life; a deep-seated need for validation through consistent achievement; a desire for emotional stability despite anxiety about failure.",
        "emotions": "A mix of stress from overwhelming work demands, guilt over being overly critical to colleagues, and a quiet fear that she'll never measure up to her own (or others') expectations.",
